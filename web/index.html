    <h1>The Bozo Profiler</h1>

    <h2>What it can do for you</h2>

    <p>This profiler can be used to get a dump of the runtime call graph of any program
    for which you have the source code. It requires a complete recompilation of your code
    and generates a set of binary dump files which represent the program call graph.
    Right now, this profiler has been successfully used with various applications 
    such as: nautilus, mozilla, open office, eog, and gimp.
    </p>

    <p>These binary dumps can then be converted to human-readable text files. For now,
    the most interesting output file format you can select is the so-called <i>dot</i>
    format which can be used as input to the 
    <a href="http://www.graphviz.org/">graphviz</a> package to generate nice-looking
    pdf org png representations of the call graphs.</p>

    <h2>How do you get the code ?</h2>

    <p>You can get the code under the GPLv2 from the following 
    <a href="http://abridgegame.org/darcs/">darcs</a> repository:
    <a href="http://le-hacker.org/darcs/bozo-profiler">http://le-hacker.org/darcs/bozo-profiler</a>.
    The bandwidth there is a bit limited so, please, be careful.</p>

    <p>If you want to download the source code without using darcs, you can use wget:
    <pre>
     wget -r http://le-hacker.org/darcs/bozo-profiler
    </pre>
    A tarball is also available from <a href="bozo-profiler-1.1.tar.gz">here</a>.
    </p>

    <h2>An example use</h2>

    <p>I did run Nautilus with this profiler and here is a small dump extract of its output in
    <a href="out.dot">dot</a> format (graphiz) and <a href="out.png">png</a> (beware, some browsers
    crash when trying to access this <i>large</i> image so, consider downloading the image rather
    than view it online).
    </p>

    <p>This rather complex graph can be simplified by grouping function calls by module as shown
    in this <a href="nautilus.png">picture</a>. It is possible to add 
    <a href="nautilus-labels.png">labels</a> which indicate how many
    times each module called another module. You can also add a logarithmic scale for line widths
    to reflect the number of times a module calls another module as shown in this 
    <a href="nautilus-width-log.png">image</a> (this <a href="nautilus-width.png">image</a> shows
    what happens if you use a linear scale). For reference, this data was generated from
    <a href="nautilus-extract.log">this</a> raw text log file (this is only an extract of the file
    since the full log file is close to 99MBytes big).</p>
